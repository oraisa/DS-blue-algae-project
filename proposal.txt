C. Data: sources, wrangling, management
A data source we have already found and done some cleaning on is
the blue algae archive from the Lake and Sea wiki
(https://www.jarviwiki.fi/wiki/Lev%C3%A4arkisto).
The tables page there gets it's data from an api that returns
individual measurements as json. Converting the json to a more usable
format requires some processing. THL has a bunch of datasets
relating to healthcare in Finland
(https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/statistical-databases/open-data)
which could be combined with the blue algae data to see the effects of the algae
on health, for example visits to doctors. One of the challenges for the
project is finding data that might be effected by the algae.

D. Data analysis: statistics, machine learning
One challenge for the project is finding the right methods to analyse the data.
Possible methods could be looking at correlation between patient
and algae numbers, or predicting the former from the latter for example
linear regression.
